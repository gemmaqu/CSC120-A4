resubmssion reflection: I tried to fixed all the problems based on comments in gradescope.
1. Less than 2 classes, methods, or attributes do not have the required call signatures
        I fixed this by revisng the variable name in the Car class by lowercase all the variables. Also, I change the constructor in thr Train class, which previously doens't match the requiremnt in README.
2. Review capitalization / naming conventions
        fixing this by lowercase the variable in Car class.
3. Missing Javadoc comments on methods
        add javadoc comments for all class and method.
4. rubric.md incomplete / missing / did not follow instructions
        fixed this by complete the rubric.

Encapsulation has been really useful in organizing and structuring code effectively. It keeps data private and only exposing necessary methods through public accessors.
I think the hardest part for me the train class, I'm also confused about why dosen't it need main function. Also after this programming, I think I am more familiar with the java syntax now.
