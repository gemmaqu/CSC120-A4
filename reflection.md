- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Encapsulation has been really useful in organizing and structuring code effectively. It keeps data private and only exposing necessary methods through public accessors.
I think the hardest part for me the train class, I'm also confused about why dosen't it need main function. Also after this programming, I think I am more familiar with the java syntax now.
